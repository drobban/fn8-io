# fn8-io

fn8-io is a work in progress.
The aim is to emulate I/O to fn8 emulator/interpreter.

## fn8

fn8 is a CHIP-8 emulator implemented in clojure.

For detailed description of the CHIP-8 have a look at the wikipedia article
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

## Usage

Not working yet...

### Bugs
Probably, yes.

### Why?
Wouldn't it be booring to just have an fn8 interpreter consuming energy without a convinient way using it?
