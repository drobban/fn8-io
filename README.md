## Usage

lein cljsbuild once min

open resources/public/index.html

To use the emulator, you need a chip-8 program to run.

There is plenty to find on internet and after you have downloaded a program,
you can load it into memory by clicking the file icon.

To start running the program, you simply click the play icon.

### Bugs
Probably, yes.

### Why?
Wouldn't it be booring to just have an fn8 interpreter consuming energy without a convenient way using it?
